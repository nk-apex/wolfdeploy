Create a single-page web application that functions like Heroku for deploying WhatsApp bots. The app should:

1. **UI Components Required:**
   - Use the provided shadcn/ui Command component for bot selection
   - Clean, modern dashboard layout
   - Dark mode support
   - Responsive design

2. **Core Functionality:**
   - Users can select from available WhatsApp bots
   - Each bot has an app.json configuration file defining required env vars (session ID and phone number)
   - Users input their WhatsApp session ID and phone number
   - Click "Deploy" to start deployment on a VPS
   - Real-time deployment logs
   - Status tracking (deploying, running, stopped, failed)
   - Auto-generated deployment URL

3. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
   - Backend API endpoints:
     - GET /api/bots - List available bots
     - GET /api/bots/:id/app.json - Fetch bot configuration
     - POST /api/deploy - Start new deployment
     - GET /api/deploy/:id/logs - Stream deployment logs
     - GET /api/deployments - List user deployments
     - POST /api/deploy/:id/stop - Stop deployment
     - DELETE /api/deploy/:id - Delete deployment

4. **Deployment Flow:**
   - User searches/selects bot from command palette
   - Bot details page shows requirements from app.json
   - User fills in required env vars (session ID, phone number)
   - System validates inputs
   - Deployment starts with progress indicator
   - Real-time logs show Docker build and deployment process
   - Success page shows deployment URL and management options

5. **VPS Integration:**
   - Use Docker for containerization
   - Each deployment gets unique port/subdomain
   - Nginx reverse proxy for routing
   - Automatic SSL via Let's Encrypt
   - Resource limits per deployment

6. **Session Management:**
   - Secure storage of WhatsApp session data
   - Session persistence across restarts
   - QR code display for initial authentication
   - Session backup and restore

7. **Additional Features:**
   - One-click deploy from GitHub repo
   - Environment variable management
   - Deployment metrics (CPU, memory, uptime)
   - Automatic restarts on crash
   - Logs viewer with search
   - Domain management

8. **Example app.json structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "WhatsApp Bot",
  "description": "A WhatsApp bot template",
  "env": {
    "SESSION_ID": {
      "description": "WhatsApp session ID for authentication",
      "required": true
    },
    "PHONE_NUMBER": {
      "description": "Your WhatsApp phone number",
      "required": true
    }
  },
  "repository": "https://github.com/username/repo",
  "logo": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "keywords": ["whatsapp", "bot", "nodejs"]
}
Styling Requirements:

Use the provided Command component as the main navigation

Gradient backgrounds for headers

Glassmorphism effects for cards

Smooth animations for state changes

Status badges with color coding

User Experience:

Keyboard shortcuts (⌘K to open command palette)

Toast notifications for actions

Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

Loading skeletons during data fetch

Error boundaries with retry options

The final output should be a fully functional React application with all the above features, ready to be deployed on Replit. Include all necessary API routes, database schemas, and deployment
